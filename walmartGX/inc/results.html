            <h3>Health Savings Account (HSA)</h3>
            <p>If you enroll in the High Deductible Health Plan, you’ll have the opportunity to save pre-tax money in a Health Savings Account (HSA). You can use the funds to pay for a variety of qualified health care expenses. Contributing to your HSA lowers your taxable income, and you are not taxed on what you use. In addition, any interest your HSA earns is not taxed. The money in an HSA can accumulate over time&mdash;there is no "use it or lose it rule" and the funds are yours to keep.</p>
            <h3>Health Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA)</h3>
            <p>If you enroll in this plan, you are not eligible to contribute to a Health Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA). However, you will be able to use the funds from your HSA to cover eligible medical expenses.</p>
